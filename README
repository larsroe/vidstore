Description:
Basic video store application for renting and returning videos.

Need:
* Clicking on a video leads to a detail page for that video that shows one of three rental states (Rented, Available, Rented by You).
* If a video is available, a button appears, allowing the current user to mark the video "rented" 
* If a video is rented by the current user, create a button that returns the video 
* If a video is rented by someone else, display the name of the user who has it. 
* If clicking a button to rent or return a video, take the user to a login page unless they've already logged in. 
* Create basic administration interface for User and Video objects. 
* Use this administration interface to bootstrap your application with data 


TODO:
tests.py
Need to show status message if checked out or rented successfully.
If not logged in, the rent/return section should go to login
For checking out, check that the video was not already checked out.
For returning, check that the user is the one who checked it out.
Search for TODO in the code.
Show state AND button to rent
POST messages should redirect
