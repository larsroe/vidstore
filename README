Description:

Need:
* A front page that shows a list of videos available at the store 
* Clicking on a video leads to a detail page for that video that shows one of three rental states (Rented, Available, Rented by You).
* If a video is available, a button appears, allowing the current user to mark the video "rented" 
* If a video is rented by the current user, create a button that returns the video 
* If a video is rented by someone else, display the name of the user who has it. 
* If clicking a button to rent or return a video, take the user to a login page unless they've already logged in. 
* Create basic administration interface for User and Video objects. 
* Use this administration interface to bootstrap your application with data
